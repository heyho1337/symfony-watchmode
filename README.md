# info
it is a bit slow as of now, i'll optimize it in the future, but i just started with symfony and for starters i just wanted to see how can i make the basic app
sadly there is not much of a chance that this project will go live, since the watchmode api's price is really high, but it is fun to work on.
as of now, there is a day caching set on the api calls
